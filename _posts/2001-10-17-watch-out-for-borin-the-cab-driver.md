The walled city of Dubrovnik would have none of this, and 
instantly banished all of those thoughts leaving me in 
awe.  I decided to leave the sobe and get some dinner.  I 
walked down a few stairs to see the entrance to the city 
looming above me.  The view from the bridge was stunning to 
say the least, as I looked out over the small inlet where 
lightly illuminated boats hovered, protected by another arm 
of the city.  I walked down countless cobblestone streets, 
jaw gaping, running my fingers over the limestone walls 
which towered sometimes over a hundred feet above me.  

I decided to stop for dinner at the Dubrovnik Terrace.  
Almost empty it was, but fun.  As I waited on my order, I 
watched Wheel of Fortune in Croatian.  Unlike the American 
version, I didn't know any of the answers.  The man waiting 
on me, as if to challenge the old world inside the city, 
had programmed his phone to ring with the song to Brittni 
Spears "Oops, I did it again."  American culture pervades 
everywhere, unfortunately.  I ate a sea bass, which he 
promised had been caught the same day.  It was good.  A 
glass of wine was only 12 kuna, which amounted to about 
$1.50.  

Today I swam in the blue water of the sea, avoiding sea 
urchins and feeling the squish of the sea kelp underneath 
my feet on top of the volcanic rock.  Dubrovnik is truly 
beautiful.
