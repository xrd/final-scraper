I left my new "sobe" (private room) angry and bitter.  
After all the time I have put in traveling, I still should 
know better than to trust a cab driver to find me lodging.  
After a very nice stay in Hotel Lapad, I decided to call 
Borin, my cab driver from the airport to Dubrovnik, and 
accept his offer to find me something near the city 
at "1/10 the price" as he had told me.  My first mistake 
was that I should have known that there would be a finder's 
fee or a trumped up fare to the place, and thought I didn't 
see the finders fee I am sure it was there, judging by the 
bargains he found for me.  The trumped up fare was there, 
to be sure, in the form of 80 kuna, or $10.  The fare to 
the airport was twice this, but took almost 30 minutes, 
while this took five.  After exhausting myself by climbing 
up the stairs to the first sobe he found, and then arguing 
over the price for a place that I really had no interest in 
staying in, I finally succumbed to a worse deal after the 
second sobe shark latched on to me during the feeding.  
When I finally dropped my bag down the stairs, and went in 
to take a shower, I was almost not surprised to see there 
was no shower curtain, and the floor was completely soaked 
when I finished my shower.  This, despite pointing the head 
to the wall the entire time, and turning off the water to 
soap up and down.  This at a price of 150 kuna, or about 
$20, which is low all considered, but the same price I 
would have paid for breakfast, a stellar view, and a decent 
bathroom at the first joint.

The walled city of Dubrovnik would have none of this, and 
instantly banished all of those thoughts leaving me in 
awe.  I decided to leave the sobe and get some dinner.  I 
walked down a few stairs to see the entrance to the city 
looming above me.  The view from the bridge was stunning to 
say the least, as I looked out over the small inlet where 
lightly illuminated boats hovered, protected by another arm 
of the city.  I walked down countless cobblestone streets, 
jaw gaping, running my fingers over the limestone walls 
which towered sometimes over a hundred feet above me.

I decided to stop for dinner at the Dubrovnik Terrace.  
Almost empty it was, but fun.  As I waited on my order, I 
watched Wheel of Fortune in Croatian.  Unlike the American 
version, I didn't know any of the answers.  The man waiting 
on me, as if to challenge the old world inside the city, 
had programmed his phone to ring with the song to Brittni 
Spears "Oops, I did it again."  American culture pervades 
everywhere, unfortunately.  I ate a sea bass, which he 
promised had been caught the same day.  It was good.  A 
glass of wine was only 12 kuna, which amounted to about 
$1.50.

Today I swam in the blue water of the sea, avoiding sea 
urchins and feeling the squish of the sea kelp underneath 
my feet on top of the volcanic rock.  Dubrovnik is truly 
beautiful.
