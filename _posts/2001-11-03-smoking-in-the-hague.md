The Netherlands is a wonderful place to visit. Steer clear from Amsterdam during the summer time as it is all so touristy and does not resemble what the real part of the Netherlands is all about. Although the country is small, the people are fantastic. I went to school there, and had the opportunity and pleasure to meet many Dutch and foreign students. The Hague is a nice place, very small but has the government buildings, the Peace Palace and many art exhibitions going on constantly. A couple of good places to visit in the Netherlands are Utrecht, Oudewater (where the women were weighed to see if they were witches), Gouda, Leiden and of course Amsterdam. There are many cathedrals and canals of course, but there is so much more to see than that. Check out the Paradiso in Amsterdam as a must see club, the Van Gogh Museum, take a boat ride, try out the boat parties and underground places such as The Dag Maart or the Blauw Aanslaag (The Hague) and also try out the herring (which I didn't do as I don't like fish too well). Especially check out Cremers as the one and best coffee shop in the hague. I travelled and saw quite a lot on my trip to Holland but living there and immersing myself in the culture was the best part of it all. I reccomend Holland as more than a place to visit, it should be place to live and love.
